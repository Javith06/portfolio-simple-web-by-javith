# Portfolio Website

This is my **Portfolio Website**, built using **HTML** and **CSS** to showcase my skills and projects. It consists of two main pages:

- **Home:** An introduction to who I am and a summary of my skills.
- **Projects:** A showcase of my work with descriptions and links to relevant repositories or live demos.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## Purpose

I created this website to give a simple and clear overview of my work and technical skills. It serves as a personal portfolio for potential employers or collaborators.

## Live Demo

You can view the live website here: [Portfolio Website]()  


## Future Enhancements

- Adding more pages, such as an "About Me" or "Contact" page.
- Improving design with responsiveness for better mobile and tablet viewing.
- Adding JavaScript for interactivity and animations.
